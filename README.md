Q1. 	Write a program to illustrate maintaining the books in a pile. The books are placed in a stack. 
	The books can be removed from the top position only. 
	The books are represented by book id. Use Array implementation. Display the appropriate messages in case of exceptions. 


Q2.	Write a program to convert and print a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic expression to postfix expression. 
	The expression consists of parenthesis, single character operands and binary operators + - * / ^    
	Apply the concept of stack data structure to solve this problem. 

Q3.	Write a program to evaluate a valid postfix expression using stack. 
	Assume that the postfix expression is read as a single line consisting of non-negative single digit operands and binary operators. 
	The operators are^ + - * and /. 



Q4.	A call center phone system has to hold the phone calls from customers and provide service based on the arrival time of the calls. 
	Write a C program to simulate this system using queue data structure.
	Program should have options to add and remove the phone calls in appropriate order for their service. 



Q5.	Write a program to demonstrate round robin processor scheduling using circular queue (array implementation) with suitable inputs. 
	Program should have options to add, remove and display elements of the queue. 



Q6.	Write a program to Implement the Stack data structure using singly Linked list.  
	Search through the list. Display the elements of the stack.


Q7.	Write a program to Implement the Queue data structure using Singly Linked list. 
	Search through the list. Display the elements of the stack.


Q8.	Write C program to perform the following operations with respect to Doubly Linked List

	a.Insertion at the front
	b.Delete based on position
	c.Print the contents in the order of insertion
	d.Print the content in the reverse order of insertion


Q9.	Write a C program to with respect to Binary Search Trees
	
	a.Creation and insertion into a Binary Search Tree
	b.Display the contents of the tree in inorder, postorder and preorder manner.
	c.Search for a given element in the BST.
